# Hello! Is it me you're looking for?

Throughout my 25+ year journey as a software engineer and data scientist, I've had the privilege of partnering with diverse teams to build scalable web platforms and uncover meaningful insights from data. What drives me most is the opportunity to create solutions that make a real difference for the people and organizations I work with.

My passion lies in full-stack development, data analysis, and machine learning – always with an eye toward delivering outcomes that truly matter.

Beyond the technical side, I'm particularly energized by SEO strategy, generative engine optimization (GEO), website performance optimization, and analytics integration – areas where I can directly impact how organizations connect with their audiences.

The convergence of traditional search and AI-powered answer engines has created new opportunities to architect content systems that serve both human users and machine understanding. I help organizations navigate this evolving landscape by implementing technical SEO foundations, structured data strategies, and content architectures optimized for discoverability across all platforms.

The most effective solutions emerge from understanding both the technical possibilities and the human needs behind them, which is why I focus on designing systems that are not only robust and scalable but also discoverable and genuinely aligned with what organizations are trying to achieve.

I specialize in helping technical companies and data-driven organizations optimize for discoverability in the age of AI-powered search, combining deep technical knowledge with strategic content architecture to ensure visibility across both traditional search engines and emerging generative platforms.

What excites me most is the chance to collaborate with teams who are working toward something meaningful, bringing both technical expertise and a genuine commitment to their success.
