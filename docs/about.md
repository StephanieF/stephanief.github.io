# About :satellite:

Throughout my 25+ year journey as a software engineer and data scientist, I've had the privilege of partnering with diverse teams to build scalable web platforms and uncover meaningful insights from data. What drives me most is the opportunity to create solutions that make a real difference for the people and organizations I work with.

My passion lies in full-stack development, data analysis, and machine learning – always with an eye toward delivering outcomes that truly matter to my clients. I've enjoyed architecting complex websites using Drupal and modern frameworks while also delving deep into Python, R, and SQL to transform raw data into actionable insights that inform key business decisions.

Beyond the technical side, I'm particularly energized by SEO strategy, website performance optimization, and analytics integration – areas where I can directly impact how organizations connect with their audiences.

The most effective solutions emerge from understanding both the technical possibilities and the human needs behind them, which is why I focus on designing systems that are not only robust and scalable but also genuinely aligned with what organizations are trying to achieve.

What excites me most is the chance to collaborate with teams who are working toward something meaningful, bringing both technical expertise and a genuine commitment to their success.
