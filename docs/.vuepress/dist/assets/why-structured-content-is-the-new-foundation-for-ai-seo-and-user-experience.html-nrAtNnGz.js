We talked about “pages”, “layouts”, and “templates,” and our CMS interfaces mirrored that mental model. Editors thought in terms of layout and visual tweaks; developers thought in terms of routes and components.</p><p>What changed:</p><ul><li><strong>Headless and decoupled</strong> setups separated content from presentation, forcing us to think about content types, fields, and relationships instead of just screens.</li><li><strong>Component systems</strong> (design systems, JS component libraries, etc) introduced “content blocks” that can be reused, remixed, and targeted across channels.</li><li><strong>AI and LLMs</strong> now consume our sites not as pretty pages, but as text, structure, and signals. They need context, constraints, and clear semantics.</li></ul><p>That shift surfaced an uncomfortable truth: <strong>if your content model is fuzzy, your AI, SEO, and UX will be fuzzy too.</strong></p><h3 id="content-modeling-as-stealth-governance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#content-modeling-as-stealth-governance"><span>Content modeling as stealth governance</span></a></h3><p>The plan: <strong>Treat</strong> <strong>content modeling as a governance strategy</strong>, not just a technical exercise.</p><p>Instead of starting with a giant “governance program” that everyone is afraid of, teams quietly bake rules into the model:</p><ul><li><strong>Field types</strong> that enforce constraints (selects instead of free text; booleans instead of “yes/no/maybe” strings).</li><li><strong>Consistent field names</strong> across content types so that “summary,” “value proposition,” and “slug” always mean the same thing.</li><li><strong>Help text and validation</strong> embedded directly in the authoring UI, catching problems where they happen.</li><li><strong>Separate content types</strong> for things that change on different timelines (for example, clinic locations vs. clinic contact info; department canonical name vs. sponsored nickname).</li></ul><p>The result is “stealth governance”: editors get guidance without sitting through a 50‑page policy document. For AI and SEO, the upside is even bigger:</p><ul><li>Structured fields become <strong>reliable features</strong> for search indexes, analytics, and personalization engines.</li><li>LLMs and agents can rely on those fields as <strong>facts with clear meaning</strong>, instead of guessing from messy prose.</li></ul><h3 id="why-schema-org-matters-more-in-the-ai-era-than-it-did-in-the-10-blue-links-era" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-schema-org-matters-more-in-the-ai-era-than-it-did-in-the-10-blue-links-era"><span>Why [<a href="http://schema.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schema.org</a>] matters more in the AI era than it did in the “10 blue links” era</span></a></h3><p>In the old search world, you could sometimes get away with unstructured HTML as long as your copy was decent and your technical SEO was not completely broken. Structured data (JSON‑LD, microdata) was mostly about “rich results”: star ratings, FAQ accordions, breadcrumbs.</p><p>In the AI era, that is no longer enough.</p><p><strong>LLMs, AI Overviews, and custom agents need machine-readable truth.</strong> They need to know:</p><ul><li>What entities exist on this page (Organization, Person, Event, Product, MedicalEntity, etc.).</li><li>How those entities are related (this Doctor works at this Hospital, this Event is at this Location, this Article is about this Condition).</li><li>Which facts are canonical and current.</li></ul><p><a href="http://schema.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schema.org</a> is not perfect, but it is <strong>the closest thing we have to a shared vocabulary for these facts.</strong> When you express your content models in <a href="http://schema.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schema.org</a> terms and publish JSON‑LD:</p><ul><li>Search engines and AI systems can <strong>disambiguate entities</strong> instead of guessing based on string matches.</li><li>Your site becomes easier to join into <strong>larger knowledge graphs</strong>—public (Google, Bing) and private (your own internal KG).</li><li>Agents have a much better chance of pulling the right facts, for the right audience, at the right time.</li></ul><p>Put bluntly: <a href="http://schema.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**schema.org</a> is not just an SEO feature; it is a prerequisite for being legible to AI.**</p><h3 id="structured-content-→-better-ai-behavior" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#structured-content-→-better-ai-behavior"><span>Structured content → better AI behavior</span></a></h3><p>Most RAG and agent architectures follow the same pattern:</p><ol><li>Ingest content from your CMS, docs, or site.</li><li>Break it into chunks.</li><li>Embed those chunks and store them in a vector database.</li><li>At query time, retrieve relevant chunks and let the model generate an answer.</li></ol><p>When your source content is a mix of long, unstructured pages, that pipeline does exactly what you would expect: it sometimes hallucinates, sometimes contradicts itself, and often misses key details and as a result the content isn’t served effectively.</p><p>When your source content is <strong>structured and well labeled</strong>, everything gets easier:</p><ul><li>Each chunk can be aligned to a content type and ID (e.g., <code>Doctor</code>, <code>Clinic</code>, <code>FAQ</code>, <code>Guideline</code>, <code>Event</code>).</li><li>Metadata like <strong>effective dates, jurisdictions, and review status</strong> can be used to filter or rank results.</li><li>AI can be constrained to specific fields (for example, “description” + “indications” for a medical service) instead of the entire blob.</li></ul><p>On top of that, you can expose structured <strong>tools</strong> to your agents:</p><ul><li>“GetClinicById(id)” that returns normalized contact info.</li><li>“LookupEventByCanonicalSlug(slug)” that returns the current event details.</li><li>“ListDepartmentsByCondition(conditionId)” that walks your content graph.</li></ul><p>All of those tools become trustworthy <em>because</em> your content models and schema are well defined. The agent is not scraping a page and hoping; it is following relationships.</p><h3 id="structured-data-as-ux-not-just-plumbing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#structured-data-as-ux-not-just-plumbing"><span>Structured data as UX, not just plumbing</span></a></h3><p>It is tempting to file all of this under “SEO” or “data engineering” and keep UX in a separate lane. however under examination we can see <strong>structured content is a UX feature.</strong></p><p>A few concrete ways that shows up:</p><ul><li><strong>Consistent names and labels</strong> across web, app, email, and print lower cognitive load for users.</li><li><strong>Reused content blocks</strong> (for example, a department “boilerplate” or clinic “contact card”) keep details accurate everywhere.</li><li><strong>Location-aware experiences</strong> (like bandwidth-based adaptations or weather-based emergency messaging) are only safe when the underlying content and metadata are trustworthy.</li><li><strong>Inline editing of components</strong> (the “Lego bricks” model) ensures that editors are working <em>with</em> structure, not against it.</li></ul><p>Good structured content lets you build:</p><ul><li>Faster, more resilient experiences at the edge.</li><li>Safer personalization.</li><li>Clearer journeys for humans, and clearer signals for machines.</li></ul><h3 id="practical-steps-to-get-from-messy-pages-to-structured-content" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practical-steps-to-get-from-messy-pages-to-structured-content"><span>Practical steps to get from “messy pages” to structured content</span></a></h3><p>If you are staring at a legacy CMS or a Drupal/WordPress site that has grown wild over a decade, this can feel theoretical. It is not.</p><p>Here is a pragmatic, incremental path that came up again and again at Decoupled Days:</p><ol><li><strong>Pick one high‑value flow.</strong> For example, a ocation finder, a program directory, or a product catalog.</li><li><strong>Model the content as data.</strong> Define content types, fields, relationships, and naming conventions. Capture what <em>people actually do</em> (sponsored names, nicknames, seasonal locations) instead of pretending reality is simpler.</li><li><strong>Enforce structure in the CMS.</strong> Use field types, validation, and permissions. Put your best guidance in help text, not in a PDF nobody reads.</li><li><strong>Publish JSON‑LD.</strong> Map your content model to <a href="http://schema.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schema.org</a> and ship valid, linked structured data for that flow.</li><li><strong>Index first.</strong> Feed the content into search (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Algolia, etc.) and/or a vector store with good metadata to ensure you have a solid data layer that can support both traditional search experiences and future AI-powered use cases.</li><li><strong>Experiment with AI safely.</strong> Start with assistive use cases (grammar improvements, drafting, content classification) where an editor stays in the loop. Add RAG-based validation before anything auto-publishes.</li><li><strong>Measure outcomes.</strong> Track load time, search visibility, CTR, conversion, editor time saved, and error rates.</li></ol><p>Done well, this loop creates the political capital to expand the model to more content types, more channels, and more ambitious AI use cases.</p><h3 id="decoupling-is-the-enabler-structure-is-the-payoff" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#decoupling-is-the-enabler-structure-is-the-payoff"><span>Decoupling is the enabler; structure is the payoff</span></a></h3><p>Decoupled architectures, edge delivery, headless CMSs, React component libraries, vector databases—these are all means to an end. The real leverage comes from <strong>clean, structured, well‑governed content</strong> expressed in shared schemas.</p><p>That content:</p><ul><li>Drives <strong>fast, consistent, multi-channel experiences</strong> for humans.</li><li>Feeds <strong>search engines and AI overviews</strong> with unambiguous facts.</li><li>Powers <strong>agents and RAG systems</strong> that can answer questions confidently and show their work.</li></ul><p>If you are choosing what to prioritize this year, it is worth asking a simple question:</p><blockquote><p><em>If an AI agent or a search engine looked only at our structured data and content models, would it understand who we are, what we offer, and who we serve?</em></p></blockquote><p>If the answer is “not really,” that is your roadmap.</p><p>Start small, pick one slice of your domain, and treat structured content and <a href="http://schema.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schema.org</a> as first‑class citizens.
