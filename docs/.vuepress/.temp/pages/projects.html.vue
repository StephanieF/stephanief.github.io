<p>Personal software engineering projects allow me to practice technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity by experimenting with languages and products that I may not use during the execution of my daily work.</p>
<p>Everything is open source; please fork the work or comment back; the best code is collaborative.</p>

<p>As an experiment in &quot;Vibe Coding&quot; I've created a Lorem Ipsum generator, with a goal of keeping the time and cost as low as possible.</p>
<p>The secondary goal was to start creating medium posts as a way to share knowledge and practice writing skills.</p>

<p>Images manipulated by AI generation can be hard to spot by simply looking. This tool highlights and explains the changes made by AI tools.</p>
<p>As an experiment in building tools for the ChatGPT ecosphere I've created an image review tool that let's you know if an image has been maniputlated by AI and how/where those changes have been made to the image.

<p>Built in VuePress with a smattering of plugins. I've not yet had time to figure out custom theming.

<h3 id="vscode-php" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vscode-php"><span>VSCode - PHP</span></a></h3>
<p>As an ubuntu user, getting a PHP executable file set up in a way where my VSCode, Terminus ans other applications could find it, without having to maintain a full php install on my machines was a bit of a hassle.</p>
<p>I've created a docker image, with instructions on how to set up and remove a container and use it as a local executable.
