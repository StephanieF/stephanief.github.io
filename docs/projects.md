# Projects

Personal software engineering projects allow me to practice technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity by experimenting with languages and products that I may not use during the execution of my daily work.

Everything is open source; please fork the work or comment back; the best code is collaborative.

### Synthwave Ipsum

As an experiment in "Vibe Coding" I've created a Lorem Ipsum generator, with a goal of keeping the time and cost as low as possible.

The secondary goal was to start creating medium posts as a way to share knowledge and practice writing skills.
