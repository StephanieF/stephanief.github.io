# Projects

Personal software engineering projects allow me to practice technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity by experimenting with languages and products that I may not use during the execution of my daily work.

Everything is open source; please fork the work or comment back; the best code is collaborative.

### Synthwave Ipsum

As an experiment in "Vibe Coding" I've created a Lorem Ipsum generator, with a goal of keeping the time and cost as low as possible.

The secondary goal was to start creating medium posts as a way to share knowledge and practice writing skills.

### Visual Detective

Images manipulated by AI generation can be hard to spot by simply looking. This tool highlights and explains the changes made by AI tools.

As an experiment in building tools for the ChatGPT ecosphere I've created an image review tool that let's you know if an image has been maniputlated by AI and how/where those changes have been made to the image.

### Personal Site

Built in VuePress with a smattering of plugins. I've not yet had time to figure out custom theming.

### VSCode - PHP
As an ubuntu user, getting a PHP executable file set up in a way where my VSCode, Terminus ans other applications could find it, without having to maintain a full php install on my machines was a bit of a hassle.

I've created a docker image, with instructions on how to set up and remove a container and use it as a local executable.
