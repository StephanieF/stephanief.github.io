# GEO, AEO & Technical SEO Consulting

## Future-proof your discoverability with expert optimization for AI-powered search, answer engines, and traditional SEO

### The search landscape has fundamentally changed.
Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI platforms has transformed how people discover information.

I help technical companies and data-driven organizations build comprehensive discoverability strategies that work across traditional search engines, generative AI platforms, and answer engines.

### Why Work With Me

- **25+ years software engineering + modern data science** - Rare combination of deep technical skills and search optimization expertise
- **Analytics and measurable results** - Every recommendation tied to data and business outcomes
- **Hands-on technical implementation** - I write the code, not just the strategy documents



## The Search Landscape Has Changed

Traditional SEO strategies aren't enough anymore. Your potential customers are getting answers from AI overviews, featured snippets, and conversational interfaces—often without clicking through to your website. If your content isn't optimized for these new discovery channels, you're invisible to a growing portion of your audience.

### The Challenges Organizations Face

- **AI overviews and answer engines are replacing traditional search results** - Google's AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and similar platforms now provide direct answers, reducing click-through rates
- **Content must work for both humans and AI systems** - Different optimization requirements for generative AI versus traditional search engines
- **Measuring success requires new analytics approaches** - Traditional metrics don't capture AI visibility or answer engine performance
- **Most organizations lack the technical depth to optimize for GEO/AEO** - This emerging field requires both search expertise and software engineering skills



## How I Can Help

I combine technical implementation expertise with strategic thinking to build comprehensive discoverability programs. My background in software engineering, data science, and content architecture enables me to work at every level—from hands-on SQL analysis to strategic content planning.

### Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Strategy

Ensure your content appears in AI overviews, ChatGPT responses, and other generative search results. I analyze how AI systems surface information, then architect your content to maximize visibility in these emerging channels.

**What's included:**

- Current state assessment of AI visibility across major platforms
- Content gap analysis identifying opportunities for AI discovery
- Structured data architecture and implementation (Schema.org, JSON-LD)
- Content rewriting and optimization for AI comprehension
- Testing and measurement framework for tracking AI appearances
- Competitive analysis of AI visibility in your industry

### Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

Optimize for featured snippets, knowledge panels, and conversational search interfaces. I identify the questions your audience is asking and structure content to provide authoritative, AI-friendly answers.

**What's included:**

- Question-intent mapping and prioritization based on search volume and business value
- Content optimization for featured snippets and position zero results
- FAQ and Q&A content development aligned with user intent
- Schema markup implementation for rich results and knowledge graphs
- Competitive analysis of snippet capture rates
- A/B testing framework for answer formats

### Technical SEO Audits & Implementation

Identify and fix technical issues impacting discoverability. I conduct deep-dive audits using SQL analysis, Python scripts, and industry-leading tools, then provide prioritized recommendations with hands-on implementation support.

**What's included:**

- Comprehensive technical SEO audit covering crawlability, indexation, and site architecture
- Site architecture and information hierarchy review
- Performance optimization for Core Web Vitals and page experience
- Structured data implementation and validation
- Mobile optimization and accessibility review
- Hands-on technical implementation or developer collaboration
- Log file analysis to understand search engine crawling behavior

### Analytics & Performance Measurement

Build custom analytics frameworks to measure GEO/AEO/SEO performance. Using SQL, Python, and visualization tools, I create dashboards that track AI visibility, snippet performance, and ROI across all discovery channels.

**What's included:**

- Custom analytics tracking for AI discovery and answer engine appearances
- SQL-based data analysis and reporting infrastructure
- Dashboard design and implementation (Looker Studio, Tableau, or custom solutions)
- KPI framework development tied to business objectives
- Regular performance reporting and actionable insights
- Attribution modeling for discovery channel impact
- Competitive benchmarking and market analysis

### Content Strategy & Architecture

Design content structures that work for both human readers and AI systems. I help you organize, tag, and structure content for maximum discoverability across all platforms.

**What's included:**

- Content inventory and audit across all digital properties
- Taxonomy and metadata strategy development
- Information architecture redesign for optimal discoverability
- Editorial guidelines for AI-optimized content creation
- Content team training and documentation
- Content workflow optimization
- Quality assurance frameworks



## How I Work

My consulting approach combines strategic thinking with hands-on technical execution. I don't just provide recommendations—I work alongside your team to implement solutions and measure results.

### 1. Data-Driven Discovery

Every engagement begins with analysis. I use SQL queries, web scraping, and API integrations to understand your current state—traffic patterns, competitor positioning, AI visibility, and technical health. No assumptions, only data.

### 2. Strategic Planning

Based on data insights, I develop prioritized roadmaps that balance quick wins with long-term structural improvements. My recommendations are always tied to measurable business outcomes—whether that's lead generation, brand visibility, or customer acquisition.

### 3. Hands-On Implementation

I can write the code, implement the structured data, optimize the content, and build the analytics. My software engineering background means I can work directly in your codebase or collaborate effectively with your development team. I speak Python, JavaScript, R, SQL—and can work in your tech stack.

### 4. Measurement & Iteration

I establish clear metrics from day one and track progress rigorously. Regular reporting shows what's working, what isn't, and where to focus next. GEO and AEO require continuous experimentation—I help you build that capability internally.

### 5. Knowledge Transfer

I document everything and train your team so they can maintain and expand on the work. My goal is to build your organization's internal capability, not create dependence. You'll receive detailed documentation, code comments, and training materials.



## Why Choose Me

### Rare Combination of Skills

Most SEO consultants lack deep technical skills. Most software engineers don't understand search optimization. I bridge this gap with 25+ years of software engineering experience, data science expertise, and proven GEO/AEO knowledge. This unique combination enables me to see opportunities others miss.

### Hands-On Technical Execution

I write code in Python, JavaScript, R, and SQL. I can implement structured data, optimize database queries, build analytics pipelines, and work in your stack—not just tell you what should be done. When I recommend a solution, I can also implement it.

### Early Adopter Mindset

GEO and AEO are emerging fields. I stay ahead of the curve through continuous experimentation, industry research, and thought leadership. You get cutting-edge strategies based on real testing, not outdated playbooks from traditional SEO.

### Measurable Results Focus

Every recommendation ties to KPIs. Every implementation includes measurement. I use SQL and analytics tools to track progress and prove ROI. Data drives all decisions—from initial strategy to ongoing optimization.

### Collaborative Approach

I work with your team, not around them. Clear communication, thorough documentation, and knowledge transfer ensure sustainable success beyond the engagement. I adapt to your workflow and integrate seamlessly with your existing teams.



## Who I Work Best With

My consulting services are ideal for:

### Technical Companies & SaaS Organizations

Organizations selling developer tools, data platforms, analytics software, or technical infrastructure need specialized GEO/AEO strategies. I understand your products, speak your language, and know how technical audiences search. I've worked with complex B2B products and know how to make them discoverable.

### Data-Driven Organizations

If your organization values analytics, measurement, and evidence-based decision making, we'll work well together. I bring the same rigor to search optimization that you bring to your business. Every recommendation comes with supporting data.

### Organizations Ready for Change

GEO and AEO require experimentation and adaptation. The best clients are ready to test new approaches, measure results, and iterate based on data—even when it challenges existing practices. If your organization can move quickly and embrace change, we'll accomplish great things together.

### Teams That Value Technical Depth

If you've worked with SEO consultants who couldn't code, couldn't explain their recommendations, or couldn't work directly with your engineering team, you'll appreciate my approach. I can dive deep into technical implementations and speak the language of both marketing and engineering.



## How We Can Work Together

### Project-Based Consulting

Defined scope, timeline, and deliverables. Ideal for specific initiatives like technical audits, GEO strategy development, or analytics implementation. Typical engagements: 4-12 weeks.

### Ongoing Retainer

Continuous optimization, measurement, and iteration. Monthly hours allocated to testing new strategies, analyzing performance, implementing improvements, and staying ahead of algorithm changes.

**Best for:** Organizations that want consistent GEO/AEO leadership and continuous improvement.

### Fractional Product Marketing Engineer

Part-time embedded role for organizations that need consistent GEO/AEO leadership but aren't ready for a full-time hire. Regular sprint planning, team collaboration, and strategic guidance.

**Best for:** Growing companies that need senior-level expertise without the full-time commitment.

### Training & Workshops

Custom training sessions for marketing teams, content creators, or developers on GEO/AEO best practices, technical SEO implementation, or analytics measurement.

**Best for:** Organizations building internal capabilities and wanting to level up their teams.
